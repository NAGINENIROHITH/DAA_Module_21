# EX 3B Hamiltonian Circuit Problem
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a python program to check whether Hamiltonian path exits in the given graph.

## Algorithm
1. Initialization of DP Table:

The DP table dp[i][mask] stores whether itâ€™s possible to visit vertex i with a subset of vertices represented by mask.

2. Check All Subsets:

For each subset of vertices, attempt to add a vertex j to the path if it is connected to another vertex k that is already in the subset.

3. Backtracking with Bitmasking:

The algorithm explores all possible vertex orderings using dynamic programming, checking whether it's possible to reach each vertex with the current subset.

4. Final Check:

The algorithm checks if any vertex i has been visited with the subset of all vertices. If so, it indicates that a Hamiltonian path exists.

5. Result:

If such a path exists, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.

                    if ((i & (1 << k)) != 0 and
                             adj[k][j] == 1 and
                                     j != k and
                          dp[k][i ^ (1 << j)]):
                        dp[j][i] = True
                        break
    for i in range(N):
        if (dp[i][(1 << N) - 1]):
            return True
    return False
adj = [ [ 0, 1, 1, 1, 0 ] ,
        [ 1, 0, 1, 0, 1 ],
        [ 1, 1, 0, 1, 1 ],
        [ 1, 0, 1, 0, 0 ] ]
 
N = len(adj)
 
if (Hamiltonian_path(adj, N)):
    print("YES")

    print("NO")
```

## Result:
The Hamiltonian path program executed successfully, and it determined whether a Hamiltonian path exists in the given graph.
